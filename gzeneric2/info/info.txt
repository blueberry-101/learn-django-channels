Q. WHAT YOU HAD LEARNED IN THIS PROJECT?
A. 
I had learned about the difference between syncronous and asyncrous classes of websocket consumers by for loop.
I had learned about making groups and broadcasting message to all the channels in that group.

Q. WHAT WILL YOU CHECK IF YOU ARE FACING THIS ERROR ?

{
      File "D:\socket\djangochannels\gzeneric2\myapp\consumers.py", line 7, in connect
    channel = self.channel_name
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    AttributeError: 'MyWSconsumer' object has no attribute 'channel_name'. Did you mean: 'channel_layer'?
    WebSocket DISCONNECT /ws/gwc/ [127.0.0.1:57251]

}

A. 
This means the channel_layers in the settings have typos or its not correctly configured.

Q. WHY DO WE USE CHANNEL LAYERS?
A. 
So that the two channels can communicate with each other.
Because on for broad cast a message even two clients from the server you need channel_name and that attribute will only come when you configure your CHANNEL_LAYERS in settings.py

remember when there was typo in CHANNEL_LAYERS the self.channel_layer was returning None.
